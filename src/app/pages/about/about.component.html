    This is an unofficial client for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was made using Angular and the official <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a>
    as a fun little side project.
  </p>
  <p>
    The API is sadly very limited, as it does not return more than 500 stories.
  </p>
  <p>
    Checking user submissions is also not reliable, as the API does not differentiate between comments and stories.
  </p>

    You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/Michko13/Hacker-News-Client">here</a>.
